To use the REST Client VSCODE Extension, write GET <link> and click the button send request up top
A new window with the response info will appear in vscode.

However PostMan is also pretty cool.

Important to not add an empty line under the POST or GET request of a VS REST CLIENT File.

You can also use ### to put other requests in the same file.

The advantage of this over Postman is that this is in the root directory of the folder, very easy to share with other people and for others to use. Postman can also do this, but it is saving requests, and when you include multiple users it gets a tad complicated.
